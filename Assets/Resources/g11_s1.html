In this last game today, we want you to learn to use BOTH OPTIONS by <br/>
looking for one GOOD thing AND one CALM thing to click on in each Picture Panel.<br/><br/>

There will also be more Picture Panels in this game than the other games,<br/>
and some Picture Panels will have more pictures in them too.<br/><br/>

This means the game will take a bit longer and finding <br/>
one GOOD picture and one CALM picture might be harder.<br/><br/>

But we want you to learn to carry on looking for GOOD and looking for CALM <br/>
even if you don't feel like it. 

That means we want you to learn to NEVER GIVE UP using BOTH OPTIONS!<br/>
To remind yourself of this, say out loud now: "NEVER GIVE UP"

NEVER GIVE UP UP UP!
