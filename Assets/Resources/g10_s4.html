In the last game of the Program today, 
we want you to look for one good picture and 
one calm picture in each Picture Board and to click on each one with the mouse. 
That means we want you to Use Your Options. 
There will also be more Picture Boards in this game than the other games, 
and some Picture Boards will have more pictures in them too. 
This means the game will take a bit longer and finding one good and one calm thing might be harder. 
But we want you to remind yourself as you complete this last game to Never Give Up 
looking for good and looking for calm!
