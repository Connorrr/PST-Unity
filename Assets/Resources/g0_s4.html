During this Program, you will play games where you will see pictures on the screen all at the same time, <br/>
like the ones shown below. These are called "Picture Panels".<br/>
Some pictures will be GOOD, some pictures will be CALM, and some will be a bit unpleasant and scary.<br/><br/>

In some games, you will be asked to click on the first GOOD picture you see. <br/>
For example, in the Picture Panel shown below, there are three GOOD pictures amongst the other pictures. <br/>
These include the cute rabbit, the smiling girl, and the happy children.<br/>
Just one of these GOOD pictures needs to be clicked on, <br/>
as shown below by the white arrow (mouse cursor) on the smiling girl.
