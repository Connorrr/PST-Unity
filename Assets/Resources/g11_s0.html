We hope you are learning to look for GOOD things to focus your attention on. <br/><br/>

If you cannot find a GOOD thing to focus on, you can look for CALM things too. <br/><br/>

Calm things include things that do not make you feel upset. <br/><br/>

Therefore, you have more OPTIONS for staying happy and calm <br/>
if you look for both GOOD and CALM things. <br/>
