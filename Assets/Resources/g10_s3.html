We hope you are learning to look for good things to focus your attention on. 
If you cannot find a good thing to focus on, you can look for calm things too. 
Calm things include things that do not make you feel upset. 
Therefore, you have more options for staying happy and calm if you look for both good things 
and calm things. In this last game today, we want you to learn to Use Your Options by looking 
for a happy thing and a calm thing to focus on in each Picture Board. 
We also want you to learn to carry on doing this, even if you don't feel like it. 
That means we want you to learn to Never Give Up Using Your Options 
until you find the right things to focus on that helps you stay happy and calm.
