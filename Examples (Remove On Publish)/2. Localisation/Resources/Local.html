Hi and welcome back to the Take Action Program! <br/>

We hope you are learning to look for good things and calm things around you <br/>
and to never give up trying to do this because it will help you keep happy and calm.  <br/><br/>

This week, we want you to keep practising using your options of <br/>
looking for good things and looking for calm things, and never giving up trying to do this. <br/> <br/>

Remember that practising helps us to learn new things, so it is important to keep doing <br/>
the Take Action Program this week. Plus, there are some new games you can play <br/>
during the Program as well. <br/> <br/>

So remember, LOOK FOR GOOD, LOOK FOR CALM, and NEVER GIVE UP!!<br/> <br/>
